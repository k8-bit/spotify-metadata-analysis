# spotify-metadata-analysis
For this project, I utilized the Spotify API with Python using the pandas, spotipy, and plotly libraries to extract metadata pertaining to the characteristics of songs uploaded to Spotify by three of my favorite bands from my home state of Louisiana: Baby in the 90s, The Nocturnal Broadcast, and Wonder Kid.

The metadata was then visually analyzed to identify trends in these characteristics. 

## multiple_artist_metadata_scraper.py
Scrapes artist/album/track metadata descriptions from Spotify for multiple artists and exports to master_file.csv
